      <div><h1><strong>About the Founder</strong></h1>
      <p>
        My name is Abigail Tutu. God gave me a revelation to build this school all over the world to help people achieve their dreams and to also have a great relationship with God. This school will be a free school to help those who can't afford to pay for their eduction. It is for children from the age of 2years to any age they will use to complete. It is from kindergarten to the university. There will be a free accomodation for students who are from very far places and there will be jobs opportunities for the students after completion of the school.
